â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scripts/             # Database scripts
```

### Database Schema (Supabase)
- **users**: User management with roles
- **assignments**: Coding problems and exercises
- **submissions**: Student code submissions
- **live_classes**: Virtual classroom sessions
- **courses**: Course management
- **achievements**: Gamification system
- **user_progress**: Learning analytics

### API Endpoints
```
Authentication:
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/register
GET  /api/auth/me

Users:
GET  /api/users
GET  /api/users/students
GET  /api/users/:id/stats

Assignments:
GET  /api/assignments
POST /api/assignments
GET  /api/assignments/:id
POST /api/assignments/submit

Classes:
GET  /api/classes
POST /api/classes
POST /api/classes/:id/join

Courses:

PUT  /api/courses/:id
```

## Performance Targets

### Frontend Performance
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.0s
- 3D Scene Load Time: < 2.0s
- Mobile Performance Score: > 90

### Backend Performance
- API Response Time: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Database Query Time: < 100ms
- WebSocket Latency: < 50ms
- Code Execution Time: < 5s

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Security
- XSS prevention with input sanitization
- CSRF protection with tokens
- Secure token storage
- Content Security Policy implementation

### Backend Security
- JWT token validation
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- Input validation with Zod
- SQL injection prevention
- File upload security
- Code execution sandboxing

## Testing Strategy

### Frontend Testing
- Unit tests for components (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- Integration tests for 3D scenes
- E2E tests for user workflows (Playwright)
- Visual regression tests for 3D elements
- Performance testing for 3D rendering

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for services and controllers
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database testing with test fixtures
- Security testing for vulnerabilities
- Load testing for concurrent users

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Frontend: Vite dev server (localhost:3000)
- Backend: Express server (localhost:5000)
- Database: Supabase (cloud)
- Real-time: Socket.IO

### Production Environment
- Frontend: Vercel/Netlify (CDN deployment)
- Backend: Railway/Render (containerized deployment)
- Database: Supabase (production instance)
- Monitoring: Sentry for error tracking
- Analytics: Custom dashboard with 3D visualizations

## Success Metrics

### User Experience

- Course completion rate: +25%
- Student satisfaction score: > 4.5/5
- Teacher productivity: +30%

### Technical Metrics
- 99.9% uptime
- < 2s average page load time
- < 100ms API response time
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **3D Performance on Mobile**: Progressive enhancement, fallback 2D interface
- **Browser Compatibility**: Polyfills and feature detection
- **Large Bundle Size**: Code splitting and lazy loading
- **WebGL Support**: Graceful degradation to 2D interface

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Comprehensive training and onboarding
- **Data Migration**: Careful migration strategy with rollback plan
- **Performance Issues**: Extensive testing and monitoring
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and updates
